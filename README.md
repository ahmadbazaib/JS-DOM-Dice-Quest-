## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns rolling a single die.
   - On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they want, with the number rolled being added to their current turn's score.

   - If the player rolls a **1**, their current turn's score is lost, and their turn ends immediately.

3. **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
